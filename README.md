# NFA TO DFA (with epsilon transitions)
+ This is an Assignment for the CS201 course.

+ I tried to implement the concepts of **data structures** taught to us in the last semester to do this assignment. I used the concepts of TREES to implement this



## Aknowledgements:
+ I learnt the process of converting an NFA containing Îµ moves to an equivalent DFA from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN8zvENdjBg) video from YouTube. This video only contains the process and no codes are shown here.

+ I am truly indebted to [Prof. SUBHANKAR MISHRA](https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/) for teaching us data structures in Python last semester. It was really a great help for me.

+ I took help of some python modules which really came handy to display the results in an organized way.
